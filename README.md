# Technical Enhanced

Technical Enhanced is a complete Minecraft modpack that adds pre-configured features for 'Technical Minecraft' but also optimizations and visual enhancements.

Feel free to add your own mods and resources or remove included ones.
([Read the License](/LICENSE))

I personally use this pack so all mods will be kept up to date as is convenient.

⚑ [Issues](https://github.com/BelisariusMC/TechnicalEnhanced/issues) (mod suggestions, bug reports)

Notes:
* The client uses Starlight mod for improving the light engine performance, but the server side uses Phosphor so light supressors can work


## Patch Notes

<details>
  <summary>Versioning</summary>
<br/>

> The version format is x.y.z,
> 
> Where the x of a version is the revision (a mod list change), the y is the patch (an update to a mod or a change to a config), the z is the hotpatch (there might be a few hotpatches in the span of an hour since the release of a patch in case i keep forgetting something and i need to fix it last minute)
> 
> Whenever SO comes out for a new major Minecraft release, this is to be reset to 1.0, this approach will make things less linear and more like they are in reality - each MC version will probaly have an unique set of essential performance mods. Due to this, the MC version will always be specified in the name and the version number.

Version 1.0.0

<summary>1.19.1 disclaimers - do not apply yet</summary>
